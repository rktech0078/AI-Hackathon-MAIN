# Chapter 1: What Is Physical AI?

Physical AI is the next evolution of artificial intelligence—moving beyond screens and servers to interact with the physical world. Unlike "Digital AI" (like ChatGPT), which processes text or images in a void, **Physical AI** must understand and obey the laws of physics.

## Digital AI vs. Embodied Intelligence

| Feature | Digital AI | Physical AI (Embodied) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Environment** | Virtual, Static, Structured | Physical, Dynamic, Unstructured |
| **Input** | Text, Images, Code | Sensor Data (Vision, Lidar, Force, IMU) |
| **Output** | Text, Pixels | Motor Torques, Motion, Physical Work |
| **Cost of Failure** | Incorrect Text | Physical Damage, Safety Risks |

**Embodied Intelligence** refers to the idea that intelligence is not just a software process but is deeply rooted in the body's interaction with the environment. A robot's "brain" must be tuned to its "body" (morphology).

## Robots That Understand Physics

To operate effectively, robots need a "physics sense"—an intuitive understanding of how objects move, react, and interact.

> **Key Concept:** **Sim-to-Real Gap**
> AI models trained in simulation often fail in the real world because simulations cannot perfectly model friction, soft body deformation, and sensor noise. Physical AI seeks to bridge this gap.

Physical AI models (like **VLA** - Vision-Language-Action models) learn physics not by solving equations explicitly, but by observing cause and effect, similar to how a human child learns to walk or catch a ball.

## Role of Humanoids in Human Environments

Why build humanoids? The answer lies in our infrastructure.

*   **Stairs & Doors:** Our world is built for bipedal locomotion.
*   **Tools & Interfaces:** Drills, handles, and steering wheels are designed for human hands.
*   **Social Interaction:** A humanoid form is more relatable and intuitive for human-robot interaction (HRI).

Humanoids are the "general-purpose" hardware platform for Physical AI, capable of performing any task a human can do, provided the AI is capable enough.

## Importance of Embodiment

Intelligence is not centralized solely in the CPU/GPU. It is distributed:

1.  **Mechanical Intelligence:** The passive compliance of a robot's legs can absorb shocks without active control.
2.  **Sensorimotor Loops:** Reflexes (like stumbling recovery) happen too fast for high-level planning; they are handled by low-level controllers.

In Physical AI, the **body is part of the computation**.
