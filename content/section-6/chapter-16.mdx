# Chapter 16: Humanoid Architecture

Building an autonomous humanoid is like building a synthetic human. It requires integrating multiple complex systems into a cohesive whole.

## The Anatomy of a Humanoid

### 1. The Body (Actuators & Structure)
*   **Skeleton:** Carbon fiber or aluminum frame.
*   **Muscles:** High-torque actuators (motors + gearboxes).
*   **Design:** 12-40 Degrees of Freedom (DoF). Legs need at least 6 DoF each for stable walking.

### 2. The Nervous System (ROS 2 & DDS)
*   **Spinal Cord:** The internal network (EtherCAT or CAN bus) connecting motors to the computer.
*   **Reflexes:** Low-level motor controllers running at 1000Hz (1kHz) to maintain balance.
*   **Communication:** ROS 2 topics carry messages between the brain and the body.

### 3. The Senses (Perception)
*   **Eyes:** Stereo cameras in the head.
*   **Ears:** Microphone array for voice commands.
*   **Balance:** IMU in the torso (pelvis).

### 4. The Brain (AI & Compute)
*   **Cerebellum (Motion Control):** Handles walking gait, balance, and IK.
*   **Cerebrum (High-Level AI):** Handles VLA, reasoning, and task planning (LLMs).
*   **Hardware:** Usually an NVIDIA Jetson Orin AGX.
