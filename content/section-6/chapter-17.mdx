# Chapter 17: Capstone Requirements

The final project for this course is to build (in simulation) and program an **Autonomous Humanoid Agent**.

## The Mission

Your robot must complete the following "Grand Challenge":

> **"Go to the kitchen, find the red apple, pick it up, and bring it to the living room table."**

## Functional Requirements

To achieve this, your robot must demonstrate:

1.  **Voice Interaction:**
    *   Listen to the command via microphone (simulated).
    *   Transcribe audio to text (Whisper).

2.  **Cognitive Reasoning:**
    *   Parse the command into a plan: `[Navigate(Kitchen), Detect(Apple), Pick(Apple), Navigate(LivingRoom), Place(Table)]`.

3.  **Navigation (SLAM & Path Planning):**
    *   Map the environment.
    *   Plan a path from Start -> Kitchen -> Living Room without hitting walls.

4.  **Perception:**
    *   Identify the "Red Apple" among other objects (segmentation/detection).

5.  **Manipulation:**
    *   Plan arm trajectory to reach the apple.
    *   Grasp the apple without dropping it.

6.  **Reporting:**
    *   Speak back to the user: "Task complete. I have put the apple on the table."
