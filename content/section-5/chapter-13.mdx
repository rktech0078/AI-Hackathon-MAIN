# Chapter 13: Voice-to-Action (Whisper)

The first step in a Vision-Language-Action (VLA) pipeline is understanding the user's intent through voice.

## The Pipeline

1.  **Audio Capture:** Microphone records user command.
2.  **VAD (Voice Activity Detection):** Detects when speech starts and stops.
3.  **STT (Speech-to-Text):** Converts audio to text.
4.  **LLM:** Interprets the text.

## OpenAI Whisper

**Whisper** is a state-of-the-art open-source speech recognition model. It is robust to accents and background noise.

```python
import whisper

model = whisper.load_model("base")
result = model.transcribe("audio.mp3")
print(result["text"])
```

## Handling Ambiguity

Humans are vague. "Pick up that thing" is a hard command for a robot.
*   **Context:** The robot needs to know *what* "that thing" refers to.
*   **Clarification:** The agent should ask: "Do you mean the red cup or the blue bottle?"

This is where the **LLM** comes in—it acts as the reasoning engine to resolve ambiguity before generating robot actions.
