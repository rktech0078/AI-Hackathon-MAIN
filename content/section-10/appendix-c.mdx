# Appendix C — Glossary

*   **Actuator:** A motor or servo that moves a robot joint.
*   **DDS (Data Distribution Service):** The networking middleware used by ROS 2.
*   **DoF (Degrees of Freedom):** The number of independent ways a robot can move.
*   **End Effector:** The "hand" or tool at the end of a robotic arm.
*   **FK (Forward Kinematics):** Calculating the position of the end effector from joint angles.
*   **IK (Inverse Kinematics):** Calculating joint angles to reach a specific position.
*   **IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit):** A sensor that measures acceleration and rotation.
*   **Lidar:** Light Detection and Ranging. Uses laser pulses to measure distance.
*   **LLM (Large Language Model):** AI trained on text to generate language and reason.
*   **MPC (Model Predictive Control):** An advanced control method that optimizes actions over a future time horizon.
*   **Odometry:** Estimating position by counting wheel revolutions or analyzing camera motion.
*   **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation):** Enhancing LLM responses with external data.
*   **ROS (Robot Operating System):** Middleware for building robot applications.
*   **SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping):** Building a map while tracking position within it.
*   **URDF (Unified Robot Description Format):** XML format for describing robot models.
*   **VLA (Vision-Language-Action):** An AI model that takes vision and language as input and outputs actions.
