# Chapter 7: Simulation Concepts

Before deploying code to a physical robot (which can break, hurt someone, or run out of battery), we test in **Simulation**.

## The Digital Twin

A **Digital Twin** is a virtual replica of your physical robot and its environment.
*   **Kinematic Accuracy:** Does it move like the real robot?
*   **Visual Fidelity:** Does it look like the real world? (Important for Vision AI)
*   **Physics Fidelity:** Do objects fall, slide, and bounce correctly?

## Physics Engines

Simulators rely on physics engines to solve the equations of motion.
*   **ODE (Open Dynamics Engine):** Fast, stable, default in Gazebo Classic.
*   **Bullet:** Good for collision detection.
*   **PhysX (NVIDIA):** GPU-accelerated, extremely fast, used in Isaac Sim.

## Sensor Simulation

We don't just simulate the robot's body; we simulate its senses.
*   **Ray Casting:** Used for LiDAR. Shoots rays and measures intersection distance.
*   **Rendering:** Used for Cameras. Renders the 3D scene from the camera's perspective.
*   **Noise Models:** Real sensors are noisy. Good simulations add Gaussian noise to synthetic data to make AI models robust.
