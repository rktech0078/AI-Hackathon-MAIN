# Chapter 21: Robotics Lab Setup

Setting up a physical space for robotics requires safety and utility.

## Robot Platforms

### 1. Budget / Entry Level
*   **Unitree Go2 (Edu):** A quadruped with LiDAR and Camera. Great SDK.
*   **TurtleBot 4:** The standard ROS 2 learning platform (wheeled).
*   **Open Manipulator:** A simple robotic arm for learning kinematics.

### 2. Mini Humanoids
*   **Robotis OP3:** Small, fully programmable.
*   **TonyPi:** Very cheap, good for basic gait learning.

### 3. Advanced Humanoids
*   **Unitree G1:** A $16k humanoid capable of complex tasks.
*   **Fourier GR-1:** Another accessible humanoid platform.

## Safety Considerations

1.  **Emergency Stop (E-Stop):** Every robot must have a hardware kill switch.
2.  **Gantry / Tether:** When testing walking algorithms, hang the robot from a gantry so it doesn't break when it falls.
3.  **Fire Safety:** LiPo batteries can catch fire. Have a Class D fire extinguisher and a sand bucket nearby.
4.  **Networking:** Isolate robot traffic on a separate VLAN to prevent network congestion.
