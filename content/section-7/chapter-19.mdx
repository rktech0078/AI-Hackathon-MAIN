# Chapter 19: Hardware Requirements

To participate in the Physical AI hackathon, you need a robust development environment.

## The Workstation (PC/Laptop)

You cannot run Isaac Sim or train VLA models on a Chromebook.

*   **OS:** Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (Dual boot recommended over VM).
*   **CPU:** Intel i7/i9 (12th Gen+) or AMD Ryzen 7/9.
*   **RAM:** 32GB minimum (64GB recommended for Isaac Sim).
*   **Storage:** 1TB NVMe SSD (Simulations take a lot of space).

### The Critical Component: GPU
NVIDIA is mandatory for Isaac Sim and Isaac ROS.
*   **Minimum:** RTX 3060 (12GB VRAM).
*   **Recommended:** RTX 4080 or RTX 4090.
*   **Why?** Isaac Sim requires Ray Tracing (RTX) cores. VLA models require significant VRAM.

## Networking
*   **Router:** Wi-Fi 6 router (for low latency communication with the robot).
*   **Ethernet:** Gigabit switch for wired connections during debugging.
