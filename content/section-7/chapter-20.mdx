# Chapter 20: Edge AI Kits

If you are building a physical robot, you need an onboard computer (the "Brain").

## NVIDIA Jetson Orin

The standard for mobile robotics.
*   **Jetson Orin Nano:** Entry level. Good for basic ROS 2 and simple vision.
*   **Jetson Orin NX:** Mid-range. Good for VSLAM and basic LLMs.
*   **Jetson AGX Orin:** High-end. Desktop-class performance. Required for running VLA models or heavy simulations onboard.

## Sensors

### Cameras
*   **Intel RealSense D435i:** The industry standard for depth sensing.
*   **Stereolabs ZED 2i:** Great for outdoor stereo vision.
*   **Oak-D:** Camera with built-in AI processing.

### LiDAR
*   **RPLIDAR A1/A2:** Low cost 2D LiDAR for indoor mapping.
*   **Velodyne / Ouster:** 3D LiDAR (expensive, used in autonomous cars).

### Audio
*   **ReSpeaker Mic Array:** 4-mic array for capturing voice commands and direction of arrival (DoA).
