# Chapter 10: NVIDIA Isaac Sim

**Isaac Sim** is a robotics simulation application and synthetic data generation tool built on the **NVIDIA Omniverse** platform. It is designed for photorealism and physically accurate simulation.

## USD (Universal Scene Description)

Omniverse uses **USD**, an open-source 3D scene description and file format developed by Pixar.
*   **Layering:** You can have a base robot file and "layer" sensors or grippers on top without modifying the original file.
*   **Non-destructive editing:** Changes are stored as "deltas."

## Omniverse Pipeline

1.  **Nucleus:** The database server that stores your USD files. Allows multiple users to edit the same world simultaneously.
2.  **Kit:** The SDK that Isaac Sim is built on. You can write Python extensions to customize the simulator.
3.  **RTC (Real-Time Collaboration):** Changes made by one user appear instantly for others.

## Photorealistic Synthetic Data

Training AI models requires massive amounts of data. Collecting this in the real world is slow. Isaac Sim allows **Domain Randomization**:

*   **Visual Randomization:** Change lighting, textures, colors, and camera positions.
*   **Physics Randomization:** Change friction, mass, and damping.

This prevents the AI from "overfitting" to the simulation and helps it generalize to the real world.

## Isaac Replicator

**Replicator** is a set of APIs in Isaac Sim to automate data generation.

```python
import omni.replicator.core as rep

with rep.new_layer():
    camera = rep.create.camera(position=(0, 0, 100))
    render_product = rep.create.render_product(camera, (1024, 1024))
    
    # Randomize position of a cube
    cube = rep.create.cube(semantics=[('class', 'cube')])
    with rep.trigger.on_frame(num_frames=10):
        with cube:
            rep.randomizer.position(min=(-50, -50, 0), max=(50, 50, 0))
```
