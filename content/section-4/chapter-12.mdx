# Chapter 12: Navigation & Control

Navigation is the art of getting from Point A to Point B without hitting anything.

## Nav2 (Navigation 2 Stack)

**Nav2** is the standard navigation framework for ROS 2. It uses Behavior Trees to manage complex navigation logic.

1.  **Global Planner:** Calculates the path from Start to Goal (e.g., A* or Dijkstra).
2.  **Local Planner (Controller):** Calculates the immediate velocity commands (`cmd_vel`) to follow the path while avoiding dynamic obstacles.
3.  **Costmaps:** 2D grids representing safe and unsafe areas.

## Biped Planning (Humanoids)

Wheeled robots just roll. Humanoids must balance.
*   **ZMP (Zero Moment Point):** The point where the robot's weight is centered. To stay balanced, the ZMP must be within the support polygon (the feet).
*   **MPC (Model Predictive Control):** Predicts the robot's future state and optimizes footsteps to maintain balance.

## IK / FK Motion Planning

For the robot's arms:
*   **Forward Kinematics (FK):** Given joint angles, where is the hand?
*   **Inverse Kinematics (IK):** Given the hand position (x, y, z), what should the joint angles be?

**MoveIt 2** is the standard library for motion planning in ROS 2. It handles collision checking and trajectory generation for arms.
