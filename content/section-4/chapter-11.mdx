# Chapter 11: Isaac ROS

**Isaac ROS** is a collection of hardware-accelerated ROS 2 packages (GEMs) that run on NVIDIA GPUs (Jetson or discrete GPUs). They provide highly optimized algorithms for perception and navigation.

## GPU-Accelerated VSLAM

**Visual SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)** uses cameras to track the robot's position.
*   **Package:** `isaac_ros_visual_slam`
*   **Input:** Stereo images or RGB-D.
*   **Output:** Robot pose (Odometry).
*   **Performance:** Runs significantly faster than CPU-based SLAM (like ORB-SLAM).

## Depth Processing

Stereo cameras (like RealSense or ZED) produce disparity maps. Isaac ROS uses the GPU to compute these maps with high accuracy and speed.
*   **Package:** `isaac_ros_stereo_image_proc`
*   **Feature:** ESS (Ess Disparity) - uses AI to fill in holes in the depth map.

## Perception Nodes

Isaac ROS provides pre-trained models for object detection:
*   **YOLOv8 / DetectNet:** Detect people, cars, and objects.
*   **Segmentation:** Identify drivable surfaces vs. obstacles.
*   **AprilTags:** Fast detection of fiducial markers for docking.

## Nvblox (3D Reconstruction)

**Nvblox** builds a 3D voxel map of the environment in real-time on the GPU. This is crucial for navigation, as it allows the robot to avoid 3D obstacles (like overhanging tables) that a 2D LiDAR might miss.
