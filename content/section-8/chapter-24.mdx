# Chapter 24: Personalization Button

Static text is a relic of the past. In this AI-Native book, you can **Rewrite** the content on the fly.

Located at the top of every chapter. When clicked, it triggers a re-generation of the page content (streaming).

### Modes

1.  **Simplify:** Rewrites the chapter using simple analogies. Removes complex math.
2.  **Deep Dive:** Adds mathematical proofs and code implementation details.
3.  **Hardware-Specific:**

    *   If user has **Jetson Orin**: Rewrites for ARM64 / Ubuntu 22.04.

## Implementation

*   **Frontend:** Fetches the raw MDX content.
