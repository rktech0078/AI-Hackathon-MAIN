# Chapter 25: Urdu Translation Button

To make robotics accessible to a wider audience in Pakistan (and globally), we include native **Urdu Support**.

## Automatic Urdu Translation

This is not a simple Google Translate overlay. It is an **AI-driven contextual translation**.

*   **Technical Terms:** Words like "Quaternion", "SLAM", and "LiDAR" are kept in English (or transliterated) because translating them often causes confusion.
*   **Tone:** The translation maintains a professional yet accessible academic tone.

## The Toggle Switch

A simple toggle in the navbar switches the entire site's language context.
*   **English:** Default.
*   **Urdu:** Right-to-Left (RTL) layout support is activated. Font changes to **Nastaliq** (if available) or a standard Urdu web font.

## Verified Glossary

We maintain a "Golden Glossary" of terms. The AI is instructed to strictly follow this glossary to ensure consistency across chapters.
