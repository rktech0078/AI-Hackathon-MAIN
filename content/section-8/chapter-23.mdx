# Chapter 23: User Signup & Personalization

To provide a tailored learning experience, we need to know who the user is.

## Authentication with Better-Auth

We use **Better-Auth** for a secure, passwordless (or social) login experience.
*   **Providers:** GitHub, Google.
*   **Storage:** User session stored in HttpOnly cookies.

## User Difficulty Adaptation

Upon signup, we ask the user:
> "What is your experience level with Robotics?"
> 1.  **Beginner:** "I don't know what a matrix is."
> 2.  **Intermediate:** "I have used ROS 1 before."
> 3.  **Advanced:** "I build custom kernels for Jetson."

This "User Level" is stored in the database and used to prompt the AI Agent.

## Personalized Examples

When the user asks "What is a Quaternion?", the AI checks their profile:
*   **Beginner:** "Think of it like a magic way to rotate objects without them getting stuck."
*   **Advanced:** "It's a 4D complex number system used to represent 3D rotations, avoiding Gimbal Lock."
